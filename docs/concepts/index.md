### Continuous Delivery Overview

Continuous Delivery (CD) approach to shipping software has been around for few years now, implemented in teams allows them to produce software in rapid cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. HawkCD helps teams to adopt CD practices in the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) by giving them the freedom to create CD Pipelines to model their release processes.

### Anatomy of a CD pipeline

*The Deployment Pipeline* is a central concept in the CD approach for shipping software. At abstract level, a deployment pipeline is an automated implementation of the software release process for getting software from version control to the market. Usually every change in the software goes through a complex process on its way to being released. The process may involve building the source code, followed by progress of these builds through numerous of stages where the product quality gets assessed. The Deployment Pipeline becomes a central collaboration hub for the software delivery team. Ability to automate the process is crucial for the team productivity.

The CD pipeline breaks down a software delivery process into stages. Each stage is aimed at verifying the software quality from a different angle to validate the functionality and prevent errors from affecting users. The CD pipeline provides feedback to the team and visibility into the flow of changes to everyone involved in the delivery
